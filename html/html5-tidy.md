# Tidy with HTML5 support

There is a tool called `tidy` which was originally written by [Dave
Raggett][tidy] (in the late '90s), and is now [maintained by
volunteers][tidy-sf] and the W3C.

There is an experimental fork of `tidy` which is maintained by the HTML Tidy
Advocacy Community Group which supports the modern HTML5 spec.

This tool takes HTML/XML/XHTML as input and produces a valid version as it's
output. It also has an errors mode where it will generate warnings and errors,
but not re-write any of the input files.
